# Tarox Project

Tarox is an interactive web-based tarot card reading application designed to offer users a visually immersive and engaging experience. The application randomly shuffles and selects tarot cards, presenting them with animated effects. Users can view card details and combinations that influence their reading.

## Features

- **Interactive Tarot Card Selection:** Users can select cards as they pulse on the screen, revealing detailed information about each card and its position in the reading.
- **Animated Card Placement:** Cards are animated with a rotation and scaling effect during placement to enhance the user experience.
- **Card Details Display:** Detailed information about the selected cards is displayed, including card images, names, and descriptions.
- **Combination Analysis:** After selecting cards, users can view possible card combinations and their interpretations, adding depth to the reading.

## How It Works

1. **Starting the Reading:** 
   - Click the "Begin" button to start the tarot card reading session.
   - The application shuffles and displays 10 cards on the screen.

2. **Selecting Cards:** 
   - Cards will pulse to indicate they can be selected.
   - Clicking on a pulsating card reveals its details and position information.
   - The selected card is locked in place, and the next card in the sequence starts pulsing.

3. **Viewing Combinations:**
   - After selecting the first card, the "Combinations" button becomes available.
   - Clicking the "Combinations" button displays any combinations of cards that might influence the reading, along with their interpretations.

## Code Overview

### HTML Structure
- The `index.php` file contains the main HTML structure, including a modal for starting the reading and buttons for user interactions.
- The page is styled and animated using external CSS and JavaScript files (`css.php`, `scripts.php`, `stars.js`, and `cardInfo.js`).

### JavaScript Functionality
- **Card Shuffling and Selection:** 
  - The `shuffleArray` function randomly shuffles the tarot cards.
  - The `selectUniqueCards` function selects 10 unique cards for the reading.
  
- **Card Placement and Animation:** 
  - The `createCardElement` function creates card elements dynamically and attaches event listeners.
  - The `animateCardPlacement` function handles the animation of cards when they are placed on the screen.
  
- **Displaying Card Details:** 
  - The `showCardDetails` function updates the card details section with information about the selected card and its position.
  
- **Combination Analysis:** 
  - The `combinations` function checks for combinations of cards based on their values and displays the associated meanings.
